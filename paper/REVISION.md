# Revision plan — items to fold into the next submission

**Status 2026-09-09 (evening):** the desk rejection was REVERSED after a formal complaint; A&C will
peer-review the manuscript (third reviewer added) once we resubmit the revised version. The editor
asked that the latest results be incorporated before review ("Please incorporate the latest results
of your models before re-submission", 2026-09-07). No deadline was stated; review begins when we
resubmit. The paper is under active consideration at A&C and may not be submitted elsewhere.

**Where each piece stands — artifact vs manuscript.** "Artifact" means computed, committed and
manifest-hashed; "In paper" means written into `paper/paper.tex`. Nothing in the second column is
done until this table says so.

The GULLS work itself is finished: the curve cache (~4 GB at
`~/Desktop/Research/microlensing/gulls_curve_cache`, outside the repo) re-scores the whole population
with any checkpoint in ~6 minutes, so threshold re-tuning or a new checkpoint is cheap. The follow-up
experiments, the 2026-09-11 verification's controls and the 2026-09-12/13 additions are the 23 rows of the ledger in §1½.
The Beginner/Experienced challenge tiers were set aside (different format, low information for this paper).

**Audit pass 2026-09-09** (`docs/AUDIT_2026-09-09.md`): two paper numbers changed — fitted-PSPL baseline AP
0.261 → 0.545 (rescored at full cadence) and the cadence experiment re-evaluated on held-out events
(AP 0.827 vs 0.830; the old protocol scored training data). Both are already in the paper via macros.

## 1. Gap sensitivity and the first cross-simulator validation — historical record (2026-08-23 to 09-10)

**Read this first.** This section records the work as it was done. The 2026-09-11 verification
(`docs/VERIFICATION_2026-09-11.md`: 182 findings, 61 issues) corrected several of its statements;
the corrections are made in place below where they are numbers, and where this section conflicts
with section 1½ or the verification record, those win. In particular: RMDC26's pause schedule
differs between seasons (the "seven pauses" below are the first season's), the calibrations below
were redone under the measured seasons, and the manuscript text lives in `paper/draft_gulls_section.tex`.

**Status:** all artifacts committed (`9b921c5`, `ecd5178`). Shipped weights unchanged.

### What to say

The submitted manuscript describes the training schedule as "legacy-like" and notes that the
current GBTDS definition samples F146 every ~12 min with colour visits on a 6-h cycle. It does
not say that the real schedule has *gaps*, and it does not test them. It should, because the
shipped model fails on them.

**The finding.** The RMDC26 release from the Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey PIT (GULLS
simulator, `huggingface.co/datasets/RGES-PIT/MachineLearning`, revision `a338d5ba`) implements
its own implementation of the GBTDS schedule, in which F146 pauses for 43-44 h per 70.7-day
season, in six or seven pauses whose phases differ between its six high-cadence seasons
(`validation/gulls/rmdc26_schedule.json`; the seven ~6.2 h pauses used in this section are the first
season's).
BinML's training grid (`pipeline/assemble._epochs`) is continuous; the only way an epoch is lost
is SNR < 3 or saturation, and across 1,800 sampled training events in every class none contains
an empty F146 bin (in the full natural-prior pool of the cadence experiment, `cadence_local_work/work15`, 6 of 89,919: 5 NonPSPL, 1 Eruptive; a verification measurement recorded in `docs/verification/2026-09-11_findings.json`, not a reducer artifact). The model's sole prior for an empty mid-season token is the unrevealed future
of a truncated season, so it reads a gap as evidence against a clean single lens.

Inserting the first RMDC26 season's seven pauses into in-distribution events (n = 100 per class,
`validation/gulls/gap_sensitivity.json`):

| condition | PSPL | NonPSPL | Flat | PeriodicVar |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| no gaps | 0.930 | 0.980 | 1.000 | 0.990 |
| 1 gap × 1 h | 0.860 | 0.980 | 1.000 | 0.990 |
| 1 gap × 2 h | 0.860 | 0.990 | 1.000 | 0.990 |
| 1 gap × 4 h | 0.650 | 0.990 | 0.600 | 0.990 |
| 1 gap × 6 h | 0.090 | 1.000 | 0.810 | 0.990 |
| first RMDC26 season's pauses (7 × 6.2 h) | 0.110 | 0.970 | 0.080 | 1.000 |

Recall, argmax. Every single gap sits at day 43.0 for every event. A 0.5 h gap (not shown) costs nothing; 1-2 h gaps
cost 7 points of PSPL recall at this position, and the 2026-09-12 re-verification found 0-14 points at other positions,
so the single-gap figures are one draw of a position-dependent cost. The lost
PSPL events go to NonPSPL and PeriodicVar, Flat mostly to PeriodicVar; in this four-class test NonPSPL
and PeriodicVar recall are unaffected. (On the 30,013-event six-class held-out, Eruptive,
LongPeriodVar and NonPSPL also degrade and NonPSPL precision collapses; section 1½ row 2.)
Flat is NOT monotonic in gap length (1.00 → 0.60 at 4 h → 0.81 at 6 h); every condition scores
the same 100 events per class (the harness re-seeds per condition), so this is model behaviour,
not sampling noise — do not describe the degradation as monotonic. This is a property of the input
contract, not of the physics, and it is reproduced with no GULLS data at all.

**The remedy.** `pipeline/train.py --gap-aug` blanks 1–8 contiguous runs of 1–12 h in every
band and relabels. **Audit correction (2026-09-09) — describe what g08e12 actually ran with, not
the intended rule:** the "caustic inside a gap → PSPL" test used `t_anom`, which the simulator
resolves only to 7.2-day steps (the END of the first 7.2-d interval in which the anomaly became
detectable), so it tested a 6-hour slot up to 7.2 d after the real caustic — effectively an
arbitrary slot, relabelling about 0.4% of NonPSPL training presentations to PSPL essentially at
random (measured by the 2026-09-11 verification with the same random-gap rule on the cadence-experiment pool, a proxy for g08e12's own Modal pool; recorded in `docs/verification/2026-09-11_findings.json`) rather than the ones whose caustic was hidden. The "nothing detectable left → Flat" branch compares a NOISY max against the
0.02 mag floor and never fires for m ≳ 21. Neither defect touches any reported metric (both act
on training labels only), and the g08e12 result stands as measured, but the manuscript must say
the fine-tune's relabelling was approximate. Fixing the rule (finer onset resolution; noise-aware
floor) changes `--gap-aug` semantics relative to the released checkpoint, so do it under a
version flag or retrain, not silently. The existing `--cadence-aug` thins bins at random,
which is the sparse-ground-survey regime, not this one. A warm-start fine-tune from the shipped
weights on 45k natural-prior events (`validation/modal_gap_finetune.py`, 12 epochs, p = 0.8,
lr 1e-4, checkpoint `validation/gulls/weights/ft_g08e12.pt`), scored on 14,958 held-out events
(`validation/gulls/gap_finetune_g08e12.json`):

| held-out macro-F1 | shipped | fine-tuned |
|---|---|---|
| clean | 0.920 | 0.907 |
| RMDC26 schedule | 0.384 | 0.879 |
| random 1–8 gaps | 0.454 | 0.886 |

Under the RMDC26 schedule PSPL recall goes 0.078 → 0.885 and Flat 0.071 → 0.975. The cost is
1.3 macro-F1 points on clean data. Per class the F1 losses are Eruptive −0.025 (precision
0.829 → 0.790), **NonPSPL −0.021 (precision 0.685 → 0.661 — the science class gets less pure)**,
PeriodicVar −0.019 (precision 0.956 → 0.926), PSPL −0.009, Flat −0.004, LongPeriodVar −0.002.
Say this plainly; an earlier draft attributed the cost "mostly" to PeriodicVar, which the
artifact does not support. Recall/precision in gap_finetune_g08e12.json are keep_prob-WEIGHTED
population estimates; the `n` next to them is the raw unweighted support.

**Cross-simulator transfer (full population, 2026-09-09).** With the fine-tuned checkpoint BinML
can, for the first time, be scored on an independent simulator. Selection: amplitude ≥ 0.1 mag
from the metadata (GULLS simulates the whole population; its median 1S1L peak is 0.063 mag), t_E
in BinML's training support [1, 300] d (33% of all RMDC26 1S1L are sub-day, 0.3% / 0.15% of the planetary classes, so
an uncut comparison conflates timescale with lens multiplicity), **every** eligible event
(100,935 requested; 25,871 skipped: 22,170 with t0 between seasons, 3,617 before the first or after
the last season, 84 without usable F146 or enough off-event epochs for a baseline; 18,089 fell in
low-cadence seasons and are reported separately),
baseline measured empirically from the off-event flux. **56,975 dense events**, identical set
and bit-identical inputs for both models (`validation/gulls/transfer_full_*.json`, reduced by
`validation/gulls/transfer_reduce.py`):

| RMDC26 class | truth | n | PSPL | NonPSPL | PeriodicVar | ≥ 0.9042 | weighted ≥ 0.9042 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1S1L single lens | PSPL | 33,353 | 0.03 → 0.54 | 0.53 → 0.43 | 0.44 → 0.01 | **0.356 → 0.116** | 0.383 → 0.135 |
| 1S2L planet | NonPSPL | 11,388 | 0.00 → 0.17 | 0.64 → 0.83 | 0.36 → 0.00 | 0.504 → 0.457 | 0.474 → 0.512 |
| 2S2L planet + binary source | NonPSPL | 12,234 | 0.00 → 0.16 | 0.71 → 0.83 | 0.29 → 0.00 | 0.582 → 0.469 | 0.505 → 0.523 |

Shipped → fine-tuned, argmax fractions; the two right-hand columns are the fraction over the
frozen threshold, unweighted and GULLS `final_weight`-weighted (Wilson 95% half-widths are
±0.5 points for single lenses and up to ±1.8 points for the weighted planetary rates; they are in
the reduced JSON). Single-lens false alarms at the frozen threshold fall by a factor of three
(35.6% → 11.6%) while planetary recall at that threshold falls (0.50 → 0.46; 0.58 → 0.47; at a
matched false-alarm budget it rises, section 1½), and the PeriodicVar contamination disappears.
The fine-tune also lifts argmax anomaly recall on genuine binaries from 0.64/0.71 to 0.83. The
threshold was calibrated on gap-free data and is open to re-tuning for this regime.

**Preprocessing sensitivity (state it).** RMDC26 samples F146 every 12.1 min against BinML's
15-min epoch grid, so about a fifth of the used epochs hold two observations (a third of the
observations share an epoch), and colour visits leave one of eight epochs empty in about a third of
the 2-h bins (occupancy 7/8, never seen in training; section 1½). `binml.preprocess` now
reduces to one value per epoch before binning, which reproduces the training-cache
representation exactly (bit-identical on-grid). Binning the same rows by raw observation
instead gives 45.6% → 9.7% on 1S1L and 0.36/0.37 planetary recall at threshold
(`transfer_full_*_rawpool.json`): the operating point moves by ~10 points with the pooling rule,
because the per-bin min/max channels carry the noise footprint. The epoch-pooled numbers are the
ones to report, with this sensitivity disclosed.

### Where the gap-aware model's residual GULLS false alarms come from (2026-09-09, from the reduced rows)

Joining the scored 1S1L rows with the RMDC26 metadata (`rho`, `piE`, `u0lens1`) gives a clean
mechanism for the remaining 11.6%:

| rho / \|u0\| (finite-source strength) | n | false-alarm rate, g08e12 |
|---|---|---|
| < 0.03 | 18,151 | 0.046 |
| 0.03–0.1 | 8,722 | 0.100 |
| 0.1–0.3 | 3,931 | 0.229 |
| 0.3–1 | 1,743 | 0.429 |
| 1–3 | 539 | 0.646 |
| > 3 | 267 | 0.674 |

Monotonic over a factor of 15, and it persists at fixed \|u0\| < 0.1 (0.23 → 0.67 across the same
bins), so it is the source-size effect, not high magnification per se. Parallax does not drive it:
at \|u0\| ≥ 0.3 the rate is 0.033–0.049 across \|piE\| quintiles. **Cause:** `PSPLGen` is
point-source and has no parallax, while `NonPSPLGen` samples rho ∈ [1e-4, 1e-2] — so in the training
set a rounded, flattened peak only ever belonged to a binary, and the model learned "finite-source
rounding ⇒ NonPSPL". GULLS single lenses with rho/\|u0\| ≳ 0.3 (7.6% of the scored 1S1L, 6.3% of the eligible; median
\|u0\| 0.05, i.e. high magnification) are then flagged. This is a
training-set physics gap, fixable by adding finite-source single lenses (VBBinaryLensing `ESPLMag2`
is available) and fine-tuning; the curve cache re-scores GULLS in ~6 min. For the shipped
checkpoint the gap effect swamps this (0.40 → 0.26 across the same bins, i.e. no finite-source
signal visible).

**Finite-source single lenses — RESULT (2026-09-09 night).** `priors.PSPL_FINITE_SOURCE` (opt-in;
released training set unchanged), `generators.espl_magnification` (VBBinaryLensing ESPLMag2 — replaced 2026-09-11 by ESPLMag, see section 1½; rho log-uniform in
[1e-3, 1]. The rho statistics then quoted, median 0.012 / p90 0.60, describe the WHOLE 1S1L class
including its sub-day third; the scored single lenses have median 0.0087, p90 0.046, p99 0.29), regimes `fspl`
and `fspl_highmag` (U0_MAX 0.2, PSPL-heavy mix with substantial NonPSPL so "small u0 ⇒ PSPL" cannot be
learned as a shortcut), runner `validation/fspl_finetune_local.py`. Warm-start from ft_g08e12, same
gap augmentation, 12 epochs, 129,683 training events (12 `fspl` + 4 `fspl_highmag` shards), ~35 min on
the M5. Checkpoint `validation/gulls/weights/ft_fspl_g08.pt`; results in
`validation/gulls/fspl_finetune_fspl_g08.json`, `transfer_full_{fspl_g08,reduced_fspl_g08}.json`,
`transfer_tradeoff_fspl_g08.json`.

*Did it learn the physics?* Held-out PSPL recall on our own finite-source population (39,864 events,
disjoint seeds), by rho/|u0|: shipped / g08e12 / new = 0.86 / 0.80 / **0.91** at 0.3–1, 0.16 / 0.16 /
**0.62** at 1–3, 0.08 / 0.09 / **0.80** above 3. Macro-F1 0.885 / 0.870 / **0.909**; no other class
lost more than 0.013 F1 (LongPeriodVar 0.894 against 0.899 for g08e12 and 0.907 shipped; Flat 0.972,
PeriodicVar 0.975, Eruptive 0.898). Caveat: this population is the new
model's own training distribution and out-of-distribution for the other two, so their AP here (~0.53
vs 0.93) is not a regression figure — the like-for-like test is GULLS.

*Did it transfer?* GULLS, identical 56,975 matched events, frozen threshold 0.9042:

| RMDC26 class | n | g08e12 → **fspl_g08** at threshold | weighted |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1S1L single lens (false alarms) | 33,353 | 0.116 → **0.052** | 0.135 → 0.079 |
| 1S2L planet (recall) | 11,388 | 0.457 → 0.370 | 0.512 → 0.441 |
| 2S2L planet + binary source (recall) | 12,234 | 0.469 → 0.400 | 0.523 → 0.459 |

The rho/|u0| false-alarm bins collapsed as predicted: 0.046 → 0.032, 0.100 → 0.036, 0.229 → 0.066,
0.429 → 0.184, 0.646 → 0.327, 0.674 → 0.333 — halved everywhere, though the largest-source bins are
not yet at the floor. (The then-stated reason, "GULLS rho reaches 5", is a whole-class statistic;
only 43 of the 33,353 scored single lenses have rho > 1, and the high-ratio bins come from tiny |u0|.)

*Threshold shift or real gain?* Recall at **matched** single-lens false-alarm budgets
(`transfer_tradeoff_fspl_g08.json`) — the frozen threshold simply lands the new model at a lower
false-alarm rate:

| 1S1L false-alarm budget | shipped | g08e12 | **fspl_g08** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2% | 0.122 | 0.185 | **0.249** |
| 5.2% | 0.214 | 0.295 | **0.369** |
| 11.7% | 0.313 | 0.457 | **0.518** |
| 20% | 0.393 | 0.601 | **0.621** |
| mean 1S2L recall over FA ≤ 30% | 0.322 | 0.486 | **0.523** |

So at the operating point the paper actually uses (whatever false-alarm rate one accepts), the
finite-source fine-tune recovers 6–7 more points of planetary recall than g08e12 on an independent
simulator. The frozen 0.9042 threshold was calibrated on gap-free, point-source data and should be
re-calibrated on our own gapped finite-source simulations before either fine-tuned checkpoint is
used as a sidecar; that is a minutes-long job from the curve cache.

*Threshold re-calibration (`validation/gulls/calibrate_gapped_threshold.py`, results
`gapped_threshold_{fspl_g08,ft_g08e12}.json`).* The threshold is chosen the way the paper chooses it
— at the 0.90 purity target on OUR held-out simulations — but with finite-source single lenses in the
population and the RMDC26 seven-gap schedule blanked in; GULLS is only read afterwards to report the
consequence. Two results:

| checkpoint | threshold @ purity 0.90 (gapped held-out) | our held-out compl. @ purity | GULLS FA / recall 1S2L / 2S2L |
|---|---|---|---|
| ft_g08e12 | 0.9992 (saturated) | 0.001 @ 0.42 | 0.000 / 0.000 / 0.000 |
| ft_fspl_g08 | 0.9353 | 0.717 @ 0.882 | 0.031 / 0.296 / 0.329 |
| ft_fspl_g08, clean (no gaps) | 0.9289 | 0.817 @ 0.887 | 0.035 / 0.312 / 0.348 |
| (frozen 0.9042, for reference) | — | — | 0.052 / 0.370 / 0.400 |

For g08e12 the target is **unreachable**: once finite-source single lenses exist in the population its
NonPSPL precision cannot get near 0.90 at any threshold, so the search runs to 0.999 and completeness
collapses. That is the operational meaning of the rho/|u0| table — not "a few extra false alarms" but
"the paper's operating point does not exist". For the finite-source checkpoint the principled
threshold is a little stricter than the frozen one and lands GULLS at ~3% single-lens false alarms
with ~0.30–0.33 planetary recall at threshold. (SUPERSEDED 2026-09-11: these calibrations used the
first season's pauses only, no season end, colour blanked on any overlap, and a different held-out pool
per checkpoint; redone under the measured seasons on one pool, section 1½ row 4.)

*Round 2 — GULLS-matched source sizes for both classes (`fspl5`: single-lens rho ≤ 5, binary rho ≤ 0.1;
same recipe, warm-start from ft_g08e12; checkpoint `ft_fspl5_g08.pt`; `fspl_finetune_fspl5_g08.json`,
`transfer_full_reduced_fspl5_g08{,_vs_fspl_g08}.json`, `transfer_tradeoff_all.json`).* A clean NEGATIVE
result. On GULLS at the frozen threshold: FA 0.087, recall 0.445 / 0.471 — between g08e12 and round 1.
The finite-source bins are worse than round 1 (rho/|u0| 0.3–1: 0.184 → 0.355; 1–3: 0.327 → 0.486;
>3: 0.333 → 0.464) though still better than g08e12; at matched false-alarm budgets it trails round 1
at low budgets (FA 2%: 0.216 vs 0.249) and ties it at high ones (FA 11.7%: 0.513 vs 0.518; mean recall
over FA ≤ 30%: 0.528 vs 0.523). Own held-out physics check was as good as round 1 (PSPL recall 0.58 /
0.83 in the 1–3 / >3 bins), so the model learned our extended population; it just transferred less
cleanly. Most plausible reading: widening the BINARY rho to 0.1 smooths caustic features toward the
finite-source single-lens shapes, so the two classes overlap more and the round-1 discrimination is
partly lost — the combined change confounds this with the single-lens extension, so a PSPL-rho-only
run (≈1 h) is the way to settle it. Until then **ft_fspl_g08 remains the sidecar candidate.**
Single seed per arm throughout: the between-round differences in the small high-rho bins (n = 267–539)
are several times the binomial error but seed-to-seed variance of the fine-tune is unmeasured.

*Colour ablation on GULLS (2026-09-10; `gulls_transfer.py --bands F146`, identical 56,975 matched
events).* For ft_fspl_g08, removing F087/F213 lowers single-lens false alarms slightly at the frozen
threshold (0.052 → 0.048) but costs planetary recall everywhere: at a matched 5.2% false-alarm budget
1S2L recall 0.369 → 0.302 and 2S2L 0.399 → 0.334; mean 1S2L recall over FA ≤ 30% 0.523 → 0.481.
Per event the colour bands move P(NonPSPL) by a median 0.11 (p90 0.44) and flip 9.5% of threshold
decisions. WITHDRAWN READING (2026-09-11): the colour gain comes almost entirely from planetary events WITHOUT
a policy-detectable F146 anomaly (at the 5.2% budget, +0.6 points on detectable, +10 points on
undetectable binaries), so it is not evidence that colour carries anomaly signal across simulators, and
not evidence for the three-band design; its mechanism is unidentified (section 1½ row 7).

*Round 3 — attribution (`fspl5s`: single-lens rho ≤ 5, binaries UNCHANGED; `ft_fspl5s_g08.pt`;
`fspl_finetune_fspl5s_g08.json`, `transfer_full_reduced_fspl5s_g08{,_vs_fspl_g08}.json`,
`transfer_tradeoff_all.json`).* Settled: the single-lens extension helps and round 2's regression was
entirely the binary-rho widening. On the identical 56,975 GULLS events (`gulls_summary_tables.py`):

| checkpoint | FA @ frozen | 1S1L FA by rho/\|u0\| bin (<0.03 … >3) | recall @ 5.2% FA (1S2L) | mean 1S2L recall, FA ≤ 0.3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| shipped | 0.356 | 0.40 0.31 0.30 0.26 0.27 0.26 | 0.214 | 0.322 |
| ft_g08e12 | 0.116 | 0.046 0.100 0.229 0.429 0.646 0.674 | 0.295 | 0.486 |
| ft_fspl_g08 (rho ≤ 1) | 0.052 | 0.032 0.036 0.066 0.184 0.327 0.333 | 0.369 | 0.523 |
| ft_fspl5_g08 (rho ≤ 5 + binary rho ≤ 0.1) | 0.087 | 0.040 0.061 0.160 0.355 0.486 0.464 | 0.344 | 0.528 |
| **ft_fspl5s_g08 (rho ≤ 5, binaries unchanged)** | **0.048** | **0.031 0.037 0.061 0.154 0.280 0.288** | **0.390** | **0.539** |

Own held-out physics check for fspl5s: PSPL recall 0.66 / 0.84 in the 1–3 / >3 bins (g08e12: 0.20 /
0.16), macro-F1 0.906, no other class regressed. **ft_fspl5s_g08 was the sidecar candidate** (replaced on 2026-09-12 by
`ft_fspl5s_seasons_g08.pt`, §1½ row 14). The
remaining 0.28–0.29 in the largest-source bins is now the floor to chase with something other than the
prior (limb darkening, or the binary-source population, which we do not simulate at all). Caveats found
2026-09-11: its finite-source training curves carry ESPLMag2's artificial 4-8 mmag hand-off steps, and
the gain over g08e12 also includes 12 more epochs on a larger PSPL-heavy pool; both were rerun as
controls (section 1½ rows 13-14).

*Gapped-threshold calibration for fspl5s (`gapped_threshold_fspl5s_g08.json`, SUPERSEDED).* Purity-0.90
threshold on our gapped finite-source held-out set with the first season's pauses: 0.9492 (held-out
completeness 0.693 @ purity 0.897); on GULLS 2.0% single-lens false alarms with planetary recall
0.268 / 0.295 (clean-data threshold 0.9236 → 3.7% / 0.334). Under the MEASURED per-season schedule,
with the threshold chosen on the full gapped pool, the operating point is 0.957 (68% of random
validation slices 0.942–0.962): 1.6% single-lens false alarms, recall 0.244 / 0.269
(`gapped_threshold_fspl5s_g08_seasons.json`; section 1½ row 4).

*Colour ablation, both checkpoints (`transfer_colour_ablation.json`).* Removing F087/F213 costs
planetary recall at matched false-alarm budget for both: fspl_g08 0.369/0.399 → 0.302/0.334 at 5.2%
FA (mean recall 0.523 → 0.481); g08e12 0.295/0.313 → 0.253/0.271 (0.486 → 0.429). Per event the colour
bands move P(NonPSPL) by a median 0.09–0.11 and flip 9.1–9.5% of threshold decisions. The reading
"colour carries anomaly signal across simulators" is withdrawn: see the note above and section 1½ row 7.

**How to present it.** One paragraph plus the matched-budget table in the cross-simulator
subsection: the residual false alarms were traced to a missing physical effect in the training set,
the effect was added, the false alarms halved and the recall-at-budget curve moved up. (The earlier
sentence calling this the cleanest demonstration that "the training population, not the architecture,
is the lever" is withdrawn: the architecture was never varied.) Do not claim the gap is closed (the >1
bins sit at 0.28-0.29), state that the fine-tune used the pre-fix `--gap-aug` relabelling semantics
like g08e12, and state that RMDC26 was used for diagnosis and checkpoint choice (section 1½).

### What NOT to claim

- 2S2L is **not** the binary-source (1L2S) contaminant. Every 2S2L lens has a planetary
  companion (median q 1.2e-4 vs 1.4e-4 for 1S2L on the scored events: similar, not identical, KS
  p ~ 2e-18); the source is flagged binary in 55% of scored 2S2L. RMDC26 ships no 2S1L class, so
  the Gaudi (1998) degeneracy raised in §discussion is still untested, and a NonPSPL call on 2S2L
  may respond to the binary source rather than the planet. Say so.
- RMDC26's anomalous classes are entirely planetary (median q ~1.3e-4) while 82% of our NonPSPL
  evaluation events are stellar-mass-ratio binaries (median q 0.12). Do not compare GULLS recall
  with the in-distribution completeness at purity (0.879). ("Harder at matched amplitude" and "a
  factor of several below our prior" were unsupported and are withdrawn.)
- Do not describe the RMDC26 schedule as seven pauses at fixed phases; do not call the first-season
  mask "the exact schedule".
- Do not say the colour bands carry anomaly signal across simulators, that the schedule hides half
  the planets, or that 0.56 bounds generator-label recall (section 1½).
- Do not attribute the drop from 11.6% to 4.8% (or most of it) to the finite-source physics: the point-source control
  shows the extra training did most of it (section 1½ row 13). Do not quote per-event RMDC26 rates as survey rates:
  say they are per simulated event, and give the rate-weighted value where a conclusion depends on it (row 18).
- Do not call the 0.014-0.023 spread between sched_rand and g08e12 a seed spread: same seed, different pools (row 19).
- The catalogue baseline `Source_F146 + 2.5 log10(fs_F146)` is uniformly 0.471 mag brighter
  than the quiescent flux in this release. We did not use it. Mention in a footnote only if a
  referee asks how the baseline was obtained.

### Where it goes (rewritten 2026-09-11; the manuscript text is `paper/draft_gulls_section.tex`)

- **Abstract [A]:** replace the last two sentences with the draft's; the finite-source checkpoint
  is quoted at a matched false-alarm budget with the development-set caveat, and recall is quoted
  against both label sets.
- **§Limits [B]:** replace the "legacy-like schedule" paragraph with the schedule paragraph and the
  gap table (measured per-season schedule; named arms).
- **New section [C]:** cross-simulator validation (data and selection, results table, the two label
  ontologies, events between seasons, the cascade on RMDC26, the floor on the label side, what the
  test does and does not establish).
- **Discussion [D]** and **model card / data availability [E]** as in the draft.
- **Decided:** the shipped weights stay; the recommended gap-aware checkpoint (`ft_fspl5s_seasons_g08.pt`,
  finite-source single lenses + the measured-season pauses) ships alongside as `binml-gapaware.pt` with its own
  operating point, 0.956 (section 1½ rows 4, 13, 14 and 18); it is `binml/weights/binml-gapaware.pt`. Every number enters through `make_macros.py` from the artifacts named in the
  draft's macro list; the GULLS artifacts join the manifest at that step.

## 1½. Follow-up experiment ledger (rewritten 2026-09-11 after the triple check)

Rows 1-12 are the follow-ups proposed on 2026-09-09 and after; rows 13-17 were added by the
2026-09-11 verification (`docs/VERIFICATION_2026-09-11.md`, 182 findings in 61 issues, none refuted), rows 18-19
by the 2026-09-12 re-verification, rows 20-22 by the referee round and seed replicates of 2026-09-12 (checked
by a third verification the same day, `docs/VERIFICATION_2026-09-12b.md`), and row 23 by that verification's
completeness critic (corrected again by the fourth verification of 2026-09-13).
Every number below is in the artifact named in its row; the manuscript draft
(`paper/draft_gulls_section.tex`) takes them only through `paper/make_gulls_macros.py`. RMDC26 was used
for diagnosis, for the upper end of the single-lens rho prior and for choosing among the fine-tuned
checkpoints, so numbers for the chosen checkpoint are optimistic; every fine-tune but the recommended
recipe is a single seed. Three seeds of that recipe (row 20) span 0.042 in per-event 1S2L recall at the 5.2%
budget (0.022 weighted) — more than the 0.014-0.023 between two fine-tunes with one recipe on different
pools, and more than several differences between recipes; the paired event-bootstrap intervals do not
cover it.

| # | Experiment | Outcome (corrected where the verification required) | Artifacts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Finite-source single lenses in the generator, then fine-tune from g08e12 with gap augmentation | Single-lens false alarms at the frozen threshold 11.6% (g08e12) → 5.2% (round 1, rho ≤ 1) → **4.8% (round 3 `fspl5s`, single-lens rho ≤ 5, binaries unchanged)**; 1S2L recall at the matched 5.2% budget 0.295 → 0.390; rho/\|u0\| bins 0.3-1 / 1-3 / >3: 0.43/0.65/0.67 → 0.15/0.28/0.29. Round 2 (binary rho also widened to 0.1) was worse: FA 8.7%, recall 0.344. The high-ratio bins are tiny-\|u0\| events, not large sources (43 of 33,353 scored single lenses have rho > 1; p99 0.29), so "rho up to 5 to cover GULLS" was the wrong justification. Caveats found by the verification: the finite-source curves were built with ESPLMag2, which has artificial 4-8 mmag hand-off steps (row 14 reruns with the smooth function); the gain over g08e12 also includes 12 more epochs on a larger, PSPL-heavy pool (row 13 is the control); out-of-support brightness explains part of the residual (FA 11.8% at m_base < 20 vs 4.1% inside our prior). | `fspl_finetune_{fspl,fspl5,fspl5s}_g08.json`, `transfer_tradeoff_all.json`, `rmdc26_dataset_facts.json` | ✅ (controls in rows 13-14) |
| 2 | Schedule-matched augmentation | **Corrected premise:** RMDC26's pauses differ between its six high-cadence seasons (row 16); the 2026-09-10 "exact schedule" arms used the first season's pauses only (16% of scored events), so their "no transfer" result was confounded (inside season 0 that arm did beat random gaps: 0.300 vs 0.237 at 5.2%). **Rerun with single-factor arms (one pool, one recipe, relabel off in both):** training on a measured RMDC26 season drawn per example (`sched_seasons`) against random 1-12 h gaps (`rand_norelabel`): held-out AP under the measured pauses 0.921 vs 0.911 (clean 0.948 vs 0.952; both differences within the 0.018 spread of three training seeds, so on our own seasons the two are not separated); on RMDC26, single-lens FA 10.0% vs 12.8%, 1S2L recall at the 2 / 5.2 / 11.7% budgets 0.237 / 0.352 / 0.491 vs 0.179 / 0.279 / 0.433, mean recall over FA ≤ 0.3 0.501 vs 0.455, ahead in all six seasons. A fixed first-season mask generalises poorly to the other seasons (held-out AP under the measured pauses 0.568 with the relabel off, 0.401 with it on; shipped 0.169). The relabel makes no measurable difference with random gaps (AP 0.910 on vs 0.911 off) but hurts with a fixed mask: with the legacy 7.2-d onset grid, 20.1% of NonPSPL-labelled pool events (2,108 of 10,471; 7.4% of the 28,419 generated binaries) are eligible. **Schedule-matched augmentation with the measured seasons transfers; the combined finite-source + measured-season checkpoint is row 14.** | `schedule_finetune.json` (held-out on 24,011 scored of a 30,013 pool, three schedules; relabel exposure), `transfer_tradeoff_all.json` (by season), weights `validation/schedule_finetune_local.py` work dir | ✅ positive (rerun) |
| 3 | Detectability-conditioned relabelling of RMDC26 | On the first 2,500 scored 1S2L and 2S2L and 1,600 1S1L, with the training rule (single lenses never NonPSPL) and full-precision statistics: **44% / 46% of 1S2L / 2S2L carry no anomaly our policy would claim within one season** (rate-weighted 41% / 40%); pooled, 25.9% fail dchi2 ≥ 160 and 19.3% pass it but fall under 0.02 mag; rescaling the dchi2 cuts for RMDC26's 11% more F146 epochs moves this under a point. Not a ceiling: the recommended `fspl5s_seasons` flags 25% of the planetary events without a detectable anomaly (`fspl5s` 24%). Recall on detectable anomalies, recommended checkpoint: 0.543 / 0.621 at the frozen threshold, 0.411 / 0.480 at its 0.956 (generator labels 0.416 / 0.449 and 0.301 / 0.317 on this subsample); `fspl5s`: 0.474 / 0.557 and 0.325 / 0.398 at 0.957. Recall tracks significance more closely than amplitude (recommended: 0.24 at dchi2 160-500 → 0.89 above 1e5; the 2-D check by the 2026-09-12 re-verification confirms it at fixed amplitude). RMDC26's planetary classes are themselves pre-selected by GULLS' detection statistic (≥ 60 for every event). | `transfer_detectability_relabel.json`, `detectability_relabel.py`, truth cache v2 | ✅ |
| 4 | Threshold for the gapped regime, chosen on our own simulations | **Redone** under the measured per-season pauses on one common finite-source held-out pool (population-weighted NonPSPL prevalence 6.0%, vs 5.6% on the paper's test set), threshold on the full pool with the spread over 200 random 20% slices; RMDC26 read only afterwards. Full-pool threshold → RMDC26 single-lens FA / 1S2L / 2S2L recall: `fspl5s` **0.957 → 1.6% / 0.244 / 0.269** (68% slice range 0.942-0.962 → FA 1.3-2.4%); `fspl` 0.945 → 2.4% / 0.270 / 0.302; `fspl5` 0.970 → 1.8% / 0.202 / 0.225; `fspl5s_v2` 0.946 → 2.5% / 0.286 / 0.312; `fspl5s_noisy` 0.951 → 7.0% / 0.349 / 0.370; g08e12: no usable operating point (0.90 purity only on its top few events). The evaluator's own validation slice gives 0.931 for `fspl5s`, outside the 68% slice range. The 2026-09-10 calibrations (first-season pauses only, no season end, a different pool per checkpoint; `fspl5s` 0.949 → 2.0%) are superseded. | `gapped_threshold_<tag>_seasons.json` (legacy files kept) | ✅ redone |
| 5 | Noise-model matching | GULLS' F146 errors equal ours for m_base < 20 and reach 2.6× at 24-25 mag; a ~7× background variance reproduces this, a global factor does not (from truth cache v1; the re-verification's v2 recomputation gives 2.67× and 7.6×, conclusions unchanged). The noise-matched fine-tune (bkg_mult 7, `fspl5s` recipe) is worse at every matched budget (recall 0.298 vs 0.390 at 5.2%) and in false alarms (12.1% vs 4.8%), though its frozen-threshold recall is higher; single seed, single noise level, mechanism not attributed. | `gulls_noise_model.json`, `fspl_finetune_fspl5s_noisy_g08.json`, `gapped_threshold_fspl5s_noisy_g08{,_cleancal,_seasons}.json` | ✅ negative |
| 6 | Sub-day t_E single lenses (out of support) | 1,385 dense sub-day 1S1L from a random contiguous id window (median t_E 0.13 d): `fspl5s` flags 0.7% (unweighted) / 3.1% (rate-weighted) at the frozen threshold; the recommended checkpoint, whose numbers the paper quotes, 1.6% / 5.7%; argmax is PeriodicVar for 60-93% across checkpoints, so these are not read as microlensing. The released model flags 4.3% of RMDC26's 0.25-1 d single lenses (467) at its frozen threshold, against 35% of the 0.2-1 d single lenses of our own stress sweep (row 23), so timescale alone does not explain that in-house failure. | `transfer_subday*.json` | ✅ |
| 7 | Colour ablation | Removing F087/F213 lowers 1S2L recall at the matched 5.2% budget by 0.042 (g08e12), 0.067 (fspl_g08), 0.068 (fspl5s), 0.062 (recommended); 8.9-9.5% of frozen-threshold decisions flip. **Reading withdrawn:** on binaries with a policy-detectable F146 anomaly colour changes recall 0.546 → 0.575 for the recommended checkpoint (the values the paper quotes; `fspl5s` 0.534 → 0.539); on those without one it raises the flag rate 0.174 → 0.248 (`fspl5s` 0.170 → 0.270). Not evidence that colour carries anomaly signal across simulators; mechanism unidentified. | `transfer_colour_ablation.json`, `transfer_detectability_relabel.json` (colour block) | ✅ |
| 8 | Finer anomaly-onset grid | The first implementation (2026-09-11 morning) skipped the grid points next to each coarse cut (two off-by-one errors) and flipped a released default; fixed in 580e172: the default is the legacy 7.2-d grid again, and `--onset-resolution-days 0.5` is a full-grid first-detectable scan that equals the cascade definition. The relabel rule that consumes the onset is not truth-based even with an exact onset (t_anom is when the anomaly first becomes detectable, not where the caustic is), so **audit finding 9 is re-opened**. The twin trained with the first implementation (`fspl5s_v2`): FA 5.35% vs 4.85%, recall 0.375 vs 0.390 at 5.2%, finite-source bins about 4 points worse; not adopted. | `fspl_finetune_fspl5s_v2_g08.json`, `tests/test_onset_resolution.py` | ✅ |
| 9 | Peak between seasons: per-season combiner | **Corrected twice.** First, "the schedule hides half the planets" was wrong. Second, the first run's own numbers were inflated: it included events peaking before or after the survey and seeded the wing-season refit at a host peak outside the window, which labels isolated bumps as anomalies. **Rerun** on between-season events only (22.0% of eligible, pooled; 27% of single lenses but 9-10% of planetary events; 3.6% peak before or after the survey), with the refit also started at the in-window maximum, first 1,000 per class: a high-cadence season borders the gap for 76% / 91% / 86% of between-season 1S1L / 1S2L / 2S2L (whole population); a claimable anomaly is visible in a wing for 44% of scorable 1S2L and 34% of 2S2L (in-season 56% / 54%), so the gap costs 12 / 20 points; host-visible subset 51% / 37%. Re-extracted 2026-09-12 into cache v3 with the recommended checkpoint added (every `fspl5s` / g08e12 score and result reproduced exactly; curves now stored for local rescoring). Recommended checkpoint at the frozen threshold: single-lens FA 0.7% (5/739; 95% ≤ 1.6%), generator-label recall 20% / 19%, recall on wing-claimable anomalies 0.43 / 0.47 (in-season 0.54 / 0.62); at 0.956: FA 0.4%, recall 0.33. At a 5.2% budget set on this population's 739 single lenses (threshold 0.69, 38 exceedances): 0.54 / 0.61, comparable to in-season 0.53 / 0.62 at the same budget. (`fspl5s`: 0.31 / 0.38 frozen, 0.50 / 0.55 at the budget against in-season 0.50 / 0.58; g08e12 0.55 / 0.62.) Wing seasons need their own operating point. | `transfer_multiseason.json`, `multi_season.py`, cache `gulls_multiseason_cache_v3` | ✅ rerun |
| 10 | Cascade on RMDC26 | **Corrected, then rescanned.** The in-house comparison is the shipped model on our simulator (80% stellar binaries), so compare with its planetary strata; "because the anomalies are smaller" was untested and is withdrawn; the RMDC26-rate prevalence row had used the balanced scan sample (the scored set's rate-weighted planetary fraction is 22%). **Rescan** (half-day cuts, ≥ 10 F146 points per cut, unrounded probabilities, onset = first cut at which our label rule is met on GULLS' noise-free F146 curve with GULLS' errors; the first 3,000 scored single lenses and the first 1,500 of each planetary class by event id; 1,667 eligible binaries, nothing selected on model output). **Recommended checkpoint** (scanned 2026-09-12, onsets reused from the first rescan), F146 only, frozen threshold: premature 2.2% (95% 1.6-3.0%), median lag of non-premature alerts +6.5 d, detected by season end 61% (59-64%); single-lens alerts 6.2% of single lenses per season per simulated event (95% 5.4-7.1%; 8.9% weighted by event rate; 0.86 per 1,000 single lenses per day; the sample flags 4.8% on the complete season against 6.3% for all scored single lenses, so burden and purity are slightly optimistic); purity (single-lens contamination only, per simulated event) 5% at 1% planetary prevalence, 21% at 5%, 49% at RMDC26's rate-weighted 22%. At 0.956: premature 1.3%, detected 50%, lag +8.0 d, single-lens alerts 3.2%, purity 8% at 1%. Three bands, frozen: premature 1.1%, detected 59%, lag +11.5 d. (`fspl5s`, unchanged: premature 2.2%, lag +6.5 d, detected 57%, alerts 5.7%.) **Stratum by stratum (fourth verification):** RMDC26 giant planets (q 1e-3 to 1e-2, 149) 1.3% premature, 80% detected, lag +5.0 d, against in-house (shipped, our simulator) 1.4%, 89%, 4.5 d (n = 138); Neptunes (826) 2.5%, 66%, +6.5 d against 4.2%, 73%, 4.5 d (n = 48); 40% of RMDC26's eligible anomalies have q ≤ 1e-4 (668; detected 51%), a regime the in-house scan samples with 9 events. Three bands, in-house strata (from `cascade_trace.npz`): giant 91% detected, 0.7% premature; Neptune 69%, 0%; RMDC26 80% / 2.0% and 62% / 1.0%. **Premature alerts stay rare and no more frequent than in-house; alerts come later and detection is lower in each stratum (a different checkpoint on a different simulator, so the differences mix the two); at realistic prevalence the alerts need a second stage.** | `cascade_gulls.json`, `cascade_gulls.py`, cache `gulls_cascade_cache` (scan_v2, manifest `scan_models.json`) | ✅ rescanned |
| 11 | Detectability floor, label side | Fraction of 1S2L with a claimable anomaly: 70 / 64 / 60 / 56 / 49 / 40 / 27% at floors 0.005 / 0.01 / 0.015 / 0.02 / 0.03 / 0.05 / 0.1 mag. The earlier inference "the model behaves as if the floor were 0.005-0.01 mag" is withdrawn: precision of a fixed flagged set is non-increasing in the floor for any classifier. The recommended checkpoint (the values the paper quotes) flags 37% of floor-vetoed planetary events at a similar rate however far below the floor (35-40%), 16-25% with F146 alone, and 5 of 20 single lenses with a significant sub-floor static-refit misfit (95% 11-47%), so the response is not planet-specific (`fspl5s`: 40%, 38-47%, 16-20%, 10 of 20). | `floor_sensitivity.json`, `transfer_detectability_relabel.json` | ✅ |
| 12 | Usable by others | `binml.gulls` (modes peak / adjacent / all, low-cadence seasons skipped, `p_nonpspl_max`), two executed notebooks now committed (the first was gitignored, so its CI test failed on a clean checkout), `ft_g08e12.pt` committed, per-event score table `rmdc26_scores.csv.gz`. | `binml/gulls.py`, `examples/*.ipynb`, `tests/test_gulls_helpers.py`, `tests/test_notebooks.py` | ✅ |
| 13 | Continued-training control for row 1 | **The confound was real.** `pspl5s_ctrl` = the `fspl5s` pool shape (same shard indices and priors, same PSPL-heavy high-magnification companion shards; a different random realisation, since the rho draw shifts each shard's RNG stream) with point-source single lenses, same warm start from g08e12 and recipe. On RMDC26, per simulated event: single-lens FA 6.4% (g08e12 11.6%, `fspl5s` 4.8%); 1S2L recall at 5.2% 0.361 (0.295, 0.390); mean recall over FA ≤ 0.3 0.490 (0.486, 0.539); rho/\|u0\| bins 0.036 / 0.048 / 0.084 / 0.208 / 0.410 / 0.513 (fspl5s 0.031 / 0.037 / 0.061 / 0.154 / 0.280 / 0.288). **Corrected by the 2026-09-12 re-verification:** the extra training accounts for most of the false-alarm drop (2,123 of 3,885 flags remain; the physics removes 506 more, 22% of the total reduction), and the physics lowers false alarms in every bin (-14% to -44%), most in rate in the two largest-ratio bins but 190 of its 506 in bins with rho/\|u0\| < 0.1, where finite size cannot matter, so not all of it is the physics. Rate-weighted, its false-alarm reduction holds (-1.0 points, 95% -1.5 to -0.4) but its recall gain is not resolved (+0.010, -0.010 to +0.027); per event it is +0.030 (+0.021 to +0.037). Only the physics restores single-lens recall for large sources on our own finite-source held-out (1-3 / >3 bins: control 0.22 / 0.16, `fspl5s` 0.66 / 0.84). Single seed; intervals are over evaluation events. **Against the seed range of row 20:** the overall physics FA drop (−1.5 points per event, −1.0 weighted) is inside the seed spread (2.7 / 3.9 points); only the 1-3 and >3 bins per event, the 11.7% budget and mean recall exceed it; in mean recall the physics, not the extra training, carries the gain (0.486 → 0.490 → 0.539). | `fspl_finetune_pspl5s_ctrl_g08.json`, `transfer_full_pspl5s_ctrl_g08.json`, `transfer_tradeoff_all.json` (`paired_differences`), weights `ft_pspl5s_ctrl_g08.pt` | ✅ |
| 14 | Smooth finite-source magnification; combined arm; **recommended checkpoint** | ESPLMag2 has artificial 4-8 mmag steps where it hands off to the point-source formula (and errs by up to 5e-3 there); ESPLMag matches direct disc integration to ~1e-5 outside the disc. Generator switched; the legacy pool is reproducible with regimes `fspl5s_legacy{,_highmag}` (same seeds, ESPLMag2). **Smooth-function control** `fspl5s_espl_g08` (ESPLMag pool, random gaps, relabel on, and the finite-source visible amplitude in the truncation augmentation, otherwise the `fspl5s` recipe): indistinguishable from `fspl5s` (FA 4.83% vs 4.85%; 1S2L recall within 0.001 at every budget; every rho/\|u0\| bin within 0.001; recalibrated 0.956 → FA 1.6%, recall 0.244), so those two changes do nothing measurable. **Combined arm** `fspl5s_seasons_g08` (the same pool with measured-season pauses and the relabel off): per simulated event it ties `fspl5s` at every matched budget (1S2L within 0.008) and flags more single lenses at the frozen threshold (6.3% vs 4.8%, **in every rho/\|u0\| bin, most of the extra flags at rho/\|u0\| < 1**; the first version of this row and the draft wrongly said "mostly in the two largest bins", 2026-09-12 re-verification); rate-weighted it is ahead at every budget (1S2L +0.017 to +0.024, all 95% intervals above zero; 2S2L +0.045 at 5.2%); on our own held-out with the measured pauses AP 0.893 vs 0.874 (clean 0.929 vs 0.931). Own threshold 0.956 (68% 0.947-0.965) → RMDC26 FA 2.4% (1.8-3.1%; 3.5% weighted), recall 0.29 / 0.33 (0.36 weighted). **Decision (2026-09-12): the combined arm is the recommended checkpoint** (released as `binml/weights/binml-gapaware.pt`): it matches or beats `fspl5s` at every matched budget under both weightings and is better on our own held-out, which involves no RMDC26 selection; `fspl5s` had been kept only for lower false alarms at fixed thresholds (a threshold effect) and because the downstream analyses had been run on it, which are now rerun for the recommended checkpoint (rows 3, 9, 10, 11, 15, sub-day). **Qualified by row 20:** all of this is one training seed; two further seeds trail `fspl5s` per event and tie it weighted, so RMDC26 does not separate the recipes; the released run has the highest planetary recall of the three (another seed flags fewer single lenses at the frozen threshold). | `fspl_finetune_fspl5s_{seasons,espl}_g08.json`, `transfer_full_fspl5s_{seasons,espl}_g08.json`, `gapped_threshold_fspl5s_{seasons,espl}_g08_seasons.json`, `transfer_tradeoff_all.json` (`paired_differences`, `weighted`), weights `ft_fspl5s_{seasons,espl}_g08.pt`, `tests/test_fspl.py` | ✅ decided |
| 15 | Partial bin occupancy | RMDC26's colour visits leave one of eight F146 epochs empty in about 35% of the 2-h bins (34.5-35.3% across seasons); colour bins sit at 2/3 in 36-47% of colour bins per season and band (about 41%; the earlier "45%" was the first season's upper value); training never contains either. On 6,024 real RMDC26 inputs, setting the occupancy to full changes the recommended checkpoint's single-lens FA 6.8% → 5.9% and 1S2L recall 0.42 → 0.33 (`fspl5s` 4.9% → 3.6% and 0.35 → 0.26; g08e12: FA unchanged, recall 0.45 → 0.38). Imposing the pattern on our binned held-out instead is not faithful (the features still come from all epochs) and produced a spurious collapse (AP 0.51), caught before use. | `occupancy_sensitivity.json`, `gapped_threshold_fspl5s_g08_{occupancy,seasonsocc}.json` (diagnostic) | ✅ |
| 16 | The RMDC26 schedule, measured | Six high-cadence seasons of 70.7 d and four low-cadence of 65.1 d; gaps 109-120 d; 685 of 1,717 days observed; F146 paused 43-44 h per season in six or seven pauses; only the pauses near days 1.0, 35.2 and 69.5 recur; three seasons merge two pauses into one ~12 h pause; colour bins almost never empty. | `rmdc26_schedule.json`, `rmdc26_dataset_facts.json` | ✅ |
| 17 | Label-policy fragility (pre-existing) | The single-start static refit is chaotic for rare borderline events: in-house seed 304033 flips PSPL ↔ NonPSPL under a 1e-14 mag perturbation (4 of 60 trials), about one event per thousand. Disclosed, not changed (it would change the released labels). | `validation/gulls/PROVENANCE.md` | ✅ documented |
| 18 | Rate weighting and the timescale mismatch (2026-09-12 re-verification) | Every RMDC26 number had been per simulated event without saying so. The unweighted sample over-represents short single lenses: 38% of scored 1S1L have t_E < 3 d (16% weighted by `final_weight`; 1.8% of our prior's mass; medians 4.3 d for 1S1L, 13.5 d for 1S2L), and false alarms rise with timescale (recommended checkpoint 5.3% at 1-3 d to 11.7% at 30-300 d). `gulls_summary_tables.py` now writes rate-weighted blocks (Kish n_eff 8,309 single / 2,841 1S2L), each checkpoint at its own threshold, and paired bootstrap differences (400 class-stratified replicates over events; not training variance). What changes under weighting: `fspl5s` over g08e12 +0.047 instead of +0.095 at 5.2%; physics over the control unresolved; combined over `fspl5s` +0.024 instead of +0.001; measured seasons over random gaps +0.048 instead of +0.072 (robust). The draft states which conclusions depend on the weighting and gives both in Table gulls. | `transfer_tradeoff_all.json` (`sample`, `weighted`, `at_own_calibrated_threshold`, `paired_differences`), `rmdc26_scores.csv.gz` (full-precision t_E and weight) | ✅ |
| 19 | Second verification pass (2026-09-12) | Five verifiers, five adversarial checkers and a completeness critic on the corrected state: 74 findings (6 critical, 22 major, 46 minor), none refuted. Critical: the combined arm's false-alarm localisation (row 14), the physics attribution (row 13), undisclosed per-event weighting (row 18). Also: the macro generator was not fail-closed (tables written before later checks, four silent fallbacks), two values double-rounded, the checkpoint count excluded five scored arms, the "seed spread" was a pool spread, the paper's own single-slice threshold (0.931 for `fspl5s`) was not disclosed, the cascade compared a whole-population three-band number with planetary strata, the Discussion said "recovers most" of the between-season events, and several code paths (cascade/between-season caches keyed by name, a stale-output bug in the fine-tune runner, the onset window end, generation settings lost at caching).

| 20 | Seed replicates of the recommended recipe (2026-09-12; verdicts corrected by the third verification) | `fspl5s_seasons_g08` retrained with seeds 20260910 and 20260911 (same pool and recipe; the seed also sets the 80/10/10 split and so the kept epoch, 9 / 5 / 11; `pipeline/train.py` differs between the three runs' commits only in comments and truth-gated code). 1S2L recall at 5.2% per event 0.391 / 0.349 / 0.358 (weighted 0.407 / 0.386 / 0.385); frozen-threshold FA 6.3 / 4.7 / 7.3%; own held-out AP with the pauses 0.893 / 0.876 / 0.894 (clean 0.929 / 0.919 / 0.931); own threshold → RMDC26 FA 2.4 / 2.6 / 3.0%, recall 0.294 / 0.259 / 0.278. Event-bootstrap intervals CAN exclude zero between seeds (s2 − s1 −0.042, −0.049 to −0.033; s3 − s2 +0.009, −0.001 to +0.016), so they do not bound recipe differences. **How the paper uses the range (rewritten after the third verification):** a rough scale, not a test — two runs of one recipe exceed a three-run range about a third of the time — applied per budget and weighting (Table tab:seeds): differences smaller than the range are unresolved, larger ones indicative. Measured pauses vs random gaps: ahead in recall at every budget and in mean recall, both weightings. Extra training: most of the gain in false alarms and at the low budgets. Finite-source physics: the gain at 11.7% and in mean recall and the false-alarm drop in the rho/\|u0\| 1-3 and >3 bins, all per event; weighted it resolves nothing (those bins hold ~100 and ~50 effective single lenses). Recommended vs finite-source recipe: not established — its seeds differ from `fspl5s` by −0.041 to +0.001 per event and +0.002 to +0.024 weighted at 5.2%, only the released seed's weighted lead exceeding the range. (The first version of this row said the weighted lead 'does not pass' although 0.024 > 0.022, and that the extra training 'passes' at every budget; both wrong.) Decision unchanged: seed 1 stays `binml-gapaware.pt`, stated as the best of the three seeds in planetary recall at every table budget and at its own threshold (seed 2 flags fewer single lenses at the frozen threshold). | `fspl_finetune_fspl5s_seasons_g08_s{2,3}.json`, `transfer_full{,_reduced}_fspl5s_seasons_g08_s{2,3}.json`, `gapped_threshold_fspl5s_seasons_g08_s{2,3}_seasons.json`, `transfer_tradeoff_all.json` (models `_s2`, `_s3`; pairs incl. s3−s2), `rmdc26_scores.csv.gz`, weights `ft_fspl5s_seasons_g08_s{2,3}.pt` | ✅ in paper (§gulls, Table tab:seeds) |

Reference for binaries: the generator's own rule — a single-lens refit on the surviving epochs of the noise-free curve rebuilt from the stored parameters (it reproduces all 858 stored binary labels; 5 are unstable under 1e-7 seed perturbations). Truncation: released labels wrong for 10.8% of truncated binary presentations (about half still PSPL after the anomaly is detectable), and against the rule's thresholds for 16.3% LPV, 8.7% periodic, 5.0% PSPL, 3.1% eruptive presentations. Floors from the truth + 0.5-d onset: 2.4% (the non-monotone cases); + 7.2-d onset 6.4%; full-season residuals 15.2%. Measured pauses: caustic-in-gap relabel on gives PSPL to 9.4% although the anomaly survives; off keeps 2.5% NonPSPL unsupported; truth bins 1.9%. Random gaps 1.5% / 0.8% / 0.4%. Cadence thinning: legacy 41%, truth bins 10%. **Corrections the same day:** (1) the first truth rule for truncation used full-season-fit residuals and taught premature NonPSPL (now floors + onset); (2) the first version of this row and of the paper measured against the first-detectable onset, a reference the fixed rule matches by construction ('0 disagreement'), and quoted 10.5% for the pause relabel (both directions; 10.4% one way) and 16.4% for LPV (double rounding).

| 23 | Stress suite and training recipe (pre-revision errors found by the third verification's completeness critic; corrected again by the fourth, 2026-09-13) | **The 14.9M-event stress suite was scored with stage 5**, the released model's predecessor, and the paper had quoted it as the released model's. `validation/stress_rescore_local.py` regenerates the first shards of each quoted tier with the suite's seeds, class mix (`run_shard --legacy-oor-mix`) and, for the sweeps, the July generator's peak-time draw (`--legacy-t0-pad`; the fourth verification found the fixed generator had changed the sub-day population), and scores them with both checkpoints. The subset is a new realisation, not the suite's events (the fleet's software was not pinned; the regenerated natural tier labels 2.3% fewer detectable anomalies): stage 5 gives the suite's macro-F1 (0.927 vs 0.927) and differs from its other numbers by 0.007 at the median (at most 0.060), so checkpoints are compared within the subset. Released model: natural macro-F1 0.919 (its held-out 0.919), anomaly recall/precision 0.962/0.726; low q 0.909/0.325 (precision low only through prevalence); wide s 0.328 (stage 5 0.281, 64 events); long P 0.044. **The suite's sub-day 'PSPL recall 0.524' was not a single-lens recall** (43% of the weighted PSPL labels are demoted binaries): sub-day single lenses are classified PSPL 0.285 and called anomalies 69% (35% above the frozen threshold; corrected generator 0.274, 71%, 37%). Faint sources: false anomalies among microlensing events without an anomaly 3.3% → 26% (0.9% → 12% above the threshold); the sweep's anomaly precision 0.026 is set mostly by its class mix (4% binaries). The low-q and faint pools entered training at stage 4, stage 6 added pools overlapping the wide-s and sub-day sweeps: stated. **The appendix** described the base run's defaults and an earlier 10M-event v4 AWS run; it now gives the six-stage chain (peak learning rates of one-cycle schedules, from the checkpoints' optimizer states) and the logged epoch throughput. | `validation/stress_rescore_local.json`, Table `tab:stress`, `paper/canonical_numbers.json` infra | Done; Sec. limits, abstract, introduction, appendix, README, model card, evaluation.md, leakage_audit.md, PROVENANCE rewritten |

### Superseded ledger (2026-09-09 to 09-11), kept for the predictions made before each run

Superseded by the table above wherever the two differ; several outcomes below were corrected by the
2026-09-11 verification (`docs/VERIFICATION_2026-09-11.md`).

Seven post-revision experiments were proposed once the full-population GULLS numbers were final.
Each row records the prediction made BEFORE running it, what actually came out, the artifact, and
what remains. Three are done, four are open. Costs are wall-clock on the M5 (10 cores, MPS).

Neither relabel setting is right; the correct fix is the un-quantised anomaly onset (regenerate with the true `t_anom`), which is now a prerequisite for any schedule-matched training. The finite-source extension (row 1) remains the only lever that moved GULLS. The 12.1-min cadence is not an arm: `binml.preprocess` pools to one value per 15-min epoch. | `validation/gulls/schedule_finetune.json`, `transfer_full_sched_{rand,sched,sched_norelabel}.json`, weights `ft_sched_{rand,sched,norelabel}.pt`, `validation/schedule_finetune_local.py`, `pipeline/train.py --gap-schedule rmdc26 --gap-relabel-anomaly off`, `tests/test_gap_augmentation.py` | ✅ done 2026-09-11 (in-simulation positive, GULLS neutral; `t_anom` fix now blocking) |
| 3 | Detectability-conditioned relabelling of GULLS itself: apply our Δχ² + 0.02 mag floor policy to the noise-free `true_flux_uJy` of GULLS binaries and score recall against detectability labels instead of generator labels | the 1S2L "recall 0.46" counts undetectable planets as misses; this gives the first like-for-like number | **Done (6,600 events: 2,500 1S2L, 2,500 2S2L, 1,600 1S1L).** Under BinML's own policy **44% of GULLS 1S2L and 46% of 2S2L "planetary" events have no detectable anomaly** (weighted 41% / 40%): 26% fail Δχ² ≥ 160 outright, 19% pass Δχ² but fall under the 0.02 mag floor. So the generator-label recall ceiling is ~0.56, not 1. **Recall on detectable-anomaly binaries** at the frozen threshold: fspl5s 0.474 / 0.557 (1S2L / 2S2L) vs 0.380 / 0.404 on generator labels; g08e12 0.568 / 0.627 vs 0.458 / 0.465; at the matched 5.2% budget fspl5s 0.483 / 0.570. Recall is amplitude-limited: fspl5s catches 0.40 of detectable anomalies of 0.02–0.05 mag, 0.51 at 0.1–0.2 mag, 0.85 above 0.5 mag. **The model flags 40% of the floor-vetoed binaries** (Δχ² ≥ 160 but deviation < 0.02 mag; even 45% of those under 5 mmag) against 13% of the Δχ² < 160 ones and 4.9% of single lenses: it responds to statistically significant sub-floor anomalies that our label policy deliberately declines to claim. Whether those are false alarms is exactly the 0.02 mag floor's justification (REVISION §2, referee item 1). Also: 2.2% of GULLS single lenses are NonPSPL by the policy's point-source refit (median ρ/\|u₀\| 2.0 — strong finite-source); the model flags 22% of those vs 4.6% of the rest, so part of the residual large-ρ false alarms are events our own refit would call anomalous. | `validation/gulls/transfer_detectability_relabel.json`; extractor/reducer `detectability_relabel.py`; truth cache outside the repo (extensible prefix selection) | ✅ done 2026-09-10 | |

| 5 | Noise-model matching: GULLS is 3–4× noisier at the faint end than our photometry; a noise-multiplier augmentation, fine-tune, re-score | not stated | **Premise measured (overstated), remedy tried: NEGATIVE.** GULLS/ours F146 error ratio 0.95 at m_base 17–19 rising to 2.64 at 24–25 (5,261 events); a ~7× background variance reproduces it (best fit 7.4, rms 0.062 in log σ), a global multiplier does not (1.41×, rms 0.27). Fine-tune `fspl5s_noisy_g08` = the exact fspl5s recipe (same shard seeds, same warm start from g08e12) with `bkg_mult` 7: on its own noisy finite-source held-out it is fine (completeness 0.78 at purity 0.92, AP 0.93, where g08e12/shipped collapse to AP 0.54/0.56), but **on GULLS it is worse than fspl5s on every measure**: single-lens false alarms 12.1% vs 4.9% at the frozen threshold; recall at the matched 5.2% budget 0.298 vs 0.390; mean recall over FA ≤ 0.3 0.499 vs 0.538; and the finite-source bins revert toward the g08e12 pattern (0.42 / 0.58 / 0.51 vs 0.15 / 0.28 / 0.29). Calibrated on its noisy held-out (threshold 0.961): GULLS FA 5.5%, recall 0.307 / 0.329 — vs fspl5s' 2.0% / 0.268 / 0.295 at its own 0.949. Reading: the extra faint-end scatter teaches the model to discount small deviations, which is exactly the finite-source signal round 3 taught it to read; GULLS' own noise is not what limits transfer, its physics is.

But they are not recognised as microlensing either: argmax is PeriodicVar for 60–93% of them (PSPL ≤ 5%) — a 3-hour spike reads as a variable star. For t_E 0.5–1 d fspl5s already calls 22% PSPL.

| 7 | Colour ablation on GULLS: F146-only vs three-band from the cache | tells whether GULLS' colour bands help or hurt in transfer | **Colour helps for all three checkpoints.** Recall at the matched 5.2% budget (1S2L / 2S2L): fspl5s 0.322 → 0.390 / 0.354 → 0.421; fspl_g08 0.302 → 0.369 / 0.334 → 0.399; g08e12 0.253 → 0.295 / 0.271 → 0.313.

| 8 | **Onset fix** (audit finding 9): resolve `t_anom` on the 0.5 d grid the cascade evaluation uses instead of rounding it up to 7.2 d; regenerate the fspl5s pool and rerun the round-3 recipe as `fspl5s_v2_g08` | rows 2/3 showed the old grid mislabels 20% of binaries under a fixed schedule; the fine-tune labels should improve, GULLS numbers should not get worse | **Fix is correct; transfer unchanged.** Same seeds, same recipe, onset on the 0.5 d grid: held-out completeness 0.845 at purity 0.877, AP 0.934 (v1: 0.831 / 0.882 / 0.931) — a small gain in the labels' own currency. GULLS (56,975): FA 5.35% vs 4.85% at the frozen threshold, recall 0.375 vs 0.390 at the 5.2% budget, mean recall 0.532 vs 0.538, finite-source bins 0.20 / 0.33 / 0.33 vs 0.15 / 0.28 / 0.29 — marginally worse, within a point or two. Expected: with random gaps the old grid's error was diluted, so fixing it buys label correctness, not transfer. Sidecar recommendation stays `ft_fspl5s_g08.pt` (better on the external test); `ft_fspl5s_v2_g08.pt` is its label-correct twin for anyone who needs the fixed generator (any schedule-matched training must start from it). | `fspl_finetune_fspl5s_v2_g08.json`, `transfer_full_fspl5s_v2_g08.json`, `transfer_full_reduced_fspl5s_v2_g08_vs_fspl5s_g08.json`, `gapped_threshold_fspl5s_v2_g08.json`, `transfer_tradeoff_all.json` (seven models), weights `ft_fspl5s_v2_g08.pt`; `SurveyConfig.onset_resolution_days`, `tests/test_onset_resolution.py` | ✅ done 2026-09-11 |
| 9 | **Per-season combiner for peak-in-gap events** (the single-season contract's cost, measured without retraining): score every dense season adjacent to the gap, take the max anomaly probability; truth policy per season | 25.5% of eligible GULLS events (22,581 1S1L, 1,384 1S2L, 1,822 2S2L) have t0 in a 109–120 d inter-season gap and were skipped by every transfer run | **Most of the population is recoverable; the lost half of the planets is lost to the schedule, not the model.** 1,000 per class: a dense adjacent season exists for 77% / 92% / 88% (1S1L / 1S2L / 2S2L; the rest border the four low-cadence seasons); a detectable EVENT is visible in a wing for 60% / 86% / 88%; a detectable ANOMALY for 0.3% / **52% / 44%** (in-season: 56% / 54%) — the peak is unobserved, yet half the planets still leave a policy-detectable trace in a wing. fspl5s with the max-combiner: single-lens false alarms **0.4%** at the frozen threshold (0.1% at 0.949) — a wing without a peak reads as PSPL/Flat; recall on detectable-anomaly binaries 0.28 / 0.32 at the frozen threshold and **0.41 / 0.46 at the 2% / 5.2% budgets on this population** (in-season 0.48 at 5.2%); generator-label recall 0.15 / 0.16. g08e12 is similar (0.44 / 0.50 at matched budgets). Reading: a whole-light-curve model would not recover the anomalies that fall in the gap (no data), and the combiner already scores the rest with in-season-like recall and lower false alarms; what a multi-season model uniquely adds is events spanning seasons and the four low-cadence seasons (18% of eligible events, out of support today). | `validation/gulls/multi_season.py`, `transfer_multiseason.json`; cache `~/Desktop/Research/microlensing/gulls_multiseason_cache` | ✅ done 2026-09-11 |

Eligible binaries (anomaly detectable at the full window by our rule on the noise-free curve, finite onset): 1,667 of 3,000; median onset day 35. **Primary protocol (F146 only, frozen threshold): premature alerts 2.2% [1.6, 3.0] (in-house 1.6%), median non-premature lag +6.5 d (in-house +5.0 d), detected within the season 57% [55, 59] (in-house 89%)** — GULLS' eligible anomalies are smaller (down to the 0.02 mag floor at matched selection), so fewer cross within the season, but when they do the timing behaves as in-house. Three bands: premature 1.4%, lag 11 d, detected 53%. At the calibrated 0.949 threshold: premature 1.2% / 0.4% (F146 / three-band), lag 8 / 13.5 d, detected 45% / 40%. **Alert burden on single lenses: 5.7% alert at least once per season at the frozen threshold (0.80 alerts per 1,000 events per day), 2.7% at 0.949 (0.38 per 1,000 per day).** **Streaming purity** (alerts from detectable-anomaly binaries over all alerts) at a stated planetary prevalence: 1% → 5% (frozen) / 8% (0.949); 5% → 21% / 30%; at RMDC26's own rate weights (31% planetary in this sample, an over-representation) 57% / 67%.

*Superseded closing note, kept as written on 2026-09-11; its conclusions on rows 2 and 7 were reversed (see the current ledger above).* **All twelve rows done (2026-09-11).** Manuscript text for rows 1–9 drafted in `paper/draft_gulls_section.tex`; rows 10–11 add one paragraph each there (cascade on RMDC26; floor sensitivity); row 12 is repository work (helper, notebooks, docs). Manuscript text drafted in `paper/draft_gulls_section.tex` (numbers still to enter through `make_macros.py`). What moved GULLS: only the finite-source single lenses (row 1) and the colour bands (row 7). What did not: schedule-matched augmentation (row 2, gain confined to our own simulations) and noise matching (row 5, negative). What changed how the numbers should be read: the detectability relabelling (row 3) — quote recall on detectable-anomaly binaries next to the generator-label number, and say that 44–46% of GULLS planetary events carry no anomaly our policy would claim. What is out of support and stays so: sub-day t_E (row 6). Two of the seven (rows 2 and 3) turn audit finding 9 (`t_anom` quantised to 7.2 d) from a documented caveat into a measured cost; regenerating with the true onset is now the first item for any further training.

## 2. Deferred items from the pre-submission referee round

Scored 7.5/10 Major Revision (likely accept). Three of the four items were run locally on our own
simulator on 2026-09-12 and re-run after the third verification on 2026-09-13
(`validation/referee_round_local.py` -> `validation/referee_round.json`, per-event inputs archived with hashes in
`validation/referee_round_archive/`; macros `\bmlRef*`, text in §limits and §cascade); the fourth cannot be run.
Shards 90-91 are held-out-pool shards: disjoint from training, but 15% of their events are among the rows the
frozen threshold 0.904 was chosen on.

- **Sensitivity to the 0.02 mag detectability floor — label side done.** Shards 90-91 regenerated at 0.01 / 0.02 /
  0.05 mag and scored by the shipped model at the frozen threshold. The floor changes which generated events are
  kept (the byproduct keep draw offsets the random stream, which later re-synchronises), so the arms are partly
  overlapping draws: 15,206 / 15,016 / 14,636 events, of which 22% / 5% of the adopted-floor events recur in the
  0.01 / 0.05-mag arms. Population-weighted NonPSPL prevalence 6.5% / 5.5% / 4.2%; completeness 0.808 [0.791, 0.825] /
  0.891 [0.876, 0.905] / 0.948 [0.935, 0.959] (Wilson); purity 0.961 / 0.913 / 0.766; on every event AP 0.943 / 0.958 /
  0.934 and macro-F1 0.891 / 0.915 / 0.770. The ranking survives, the operating point does not. Retraining under
  another floor is not done.
- **Colour-band calibration ablation — done.** The same 15,016 events with the audited F087/F213 zeropoints,
  backgrounds and saturation (F146, exposure and cadence unchanged; identical events, 25 labels change). Shipped model:
  AP 0.958 vs 0.957, completeness 0.891 vs 0.888; the variable classes lose precision, not recall (periodic 0.949 ->
  0.908, eruptive 0.806 -> 0.776; F1 0.970 -> 0.949, 0.891 -> 0.871) because more flat sources are called periodic and
  more single lenses eruptive; no more variables are sent to microlensing. Fine-tunes on each calibration (up to three
  epochs, one seed, best epoch kept): AP 0.958-0.960 in every combination; the audited fine-tune drops to periodic F1
  0.750 on the old photometry (0.872 at its last epoch) against 0.961 (0.972) for the old-calibration fine-tune; on
  the audited photometry the two differ at the kept epoch (0.957 vs 0.917) but not at the last (0.967 vs 0.967).
  The 66-s exposure is not tested.
- **Mixed-class sequential evaluation — done.** All 15,016 events revealed in 144 half-day prefixes at the frozen
  threshold, with three bands and with F146 alone. Three bands: no Flat or variable alert; 0.77 alerts per 1,000
  events per day, 89% detectable anomalies at the simulated 5.5% prevalence (58% at 1%, 12% at 0.1%, prior shift with the
  non-anomalous mix held fixed); single-lens alerts 1.0% after reweighting (32 of 4,391 stored), 29 of them demoted
  binaries, 3 of 1,759 generated single lenses. F146 alone: 0.98 per day, 67% (26% at 1%); 51 generated single lenses and
  4 eruptive variables alert. Timing on 1,753 NonPSPL: three bands 0.7% premature [0.4, 1.2], lag +6.5 d, detection 90%
  (the in-house three-band scan: 1.0%, +7.0 d, 91%); F146 alone 1.0%, +5.0 d, 86%. Like for like with the RMDC26
  cascade (recommended checkpoint, F146, frozen threshold), 31 of the 1,759 generated single lenses alert (1.8%)
  against RMDC26's 6.2%.
- **Seed sweep of the shipped model (3 seeds, stage-6 recipe) — not possible here.** Its 1.9M-event training set is on
  S3 and AWS is unavailable (unpaid bill, 2026-09-12); regenerating it locally is days of compute. Seed spread is
  measured instead for the gap-aware recipe (three seeds of `fspl5s_seasons_g08`, §1½ row 20) and the paper says
  the shipped model's seed spread is unmeasured.
